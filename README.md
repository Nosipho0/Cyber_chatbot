The Cybersecurity Chatbot is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application developed in C# that aims to promote cybersecurity awareness through interactive learning. This desktop application offers a user-friendly interface where users can engage in a simulated conversation with a chatbot focused on cybersecurity topics such as passwords, phishing, privacy, and malware. Upon launching the application, users are welcomed with an introductory sound and a visual ASCII representation of the logo in the console. The application allows users to input their name and favorite cybersecurity topic, which helps personalize the chatbot interaction. In addition to providing useful tips and responses based on keywords, the chatbot features a multiple-choice quiz with eleven questions that help test and reinforce the user's knowledge of safe online practices. The application also includes the ability to set reminders for cybersecurity-related tasks and create and track custom tasks. All user interactions, reminders, and quiz results are logged in an activity log that can be viewed at any time. Resources such as the logo image and audio file are stored in a dedicated resources folder. This project provides a hands-on introduction to cybersecurity concepts and practical implementation using WPF, making it suitable for educational use or beginner-level development exploration.
